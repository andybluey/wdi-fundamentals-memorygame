		<h1>Memory Game</h1>
		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
		<h2>Why this game is awesome</h2>
		<p>This game is being created to showcase some of the skills I'm learning in Web Development. Overtime, this will hopefully get more and more complex.</p>
